# Shattered Ascension
## v4.2 (beta), for use with FAQ 2.4

_Shattered Ascension is a set of patch rules developed in order to improve some of the weaknesses of Twilight Imperium 3rd edition. These rules requires the expansion set Shattered Empire to use. It's recommended but not required to have two copies of TI3 accessible. This version is not directly compatable with Shards of the Throne, but the usable components and required tweaks are specified in this book._

1. Decide on the number of Victory Points required to win, and agree on each variable at the lower page.
2. Have each player roll a die. Take seat positions around the table going clockwise from high to low.
3. Deal two Secret Objective cards to each player. One of these must be discarded during step 10.
4. a) Starting with the highest rolling player and going clockwise in turns, each player may in turn choose any available race to command, or announce pass to wait for step 4b.  
  b) Remaining races are dealed out randomly, with the following advantage; they may be kept hidden and secret until the beginning of the first Strategy Phase. Upon receiving a random race, the player may reject it and draw another. A third draw is allowed, but this race must be immediately revealed.
5. Galaxy-creation (or Home System location bidding if using a pre- set scenario) will begin with the highest rolling player and progress clockwise. This order will alternate if not using pre-set maps or the Star by Star option. View appendix 6 for some sample maps and details on the bidding system.  
  b) Optional: For practical reasons, players may now change seats so that they are alligned with their HS posisions.
6. a) Bid for Speaker Token: The player with the lowest roll may now place a bid of Trade Goods (TG) on the Speaker Token (this bid may be 0). Going counter-clockwise, players may either pass or bid over. The winning bidder is assigned Speaker, and all other players then receive a number of TG equal to winning bid.  
  b) The Speaker may now set the orientation of the Rotation Cycler.
7. Normalize TG: All players now adds or subtracts the same number of TG such that the player with the lowest amount starts out with 1 TG.
8. Build two separate objective decks, one for each stage, instead of the usual mixed objective deck. Then simply draw from the appropriate pile before adding new objectives to the common play area.
9. Place all Special Objectives face up on the board, along with 3 random Public Stage I Objective cards from the deck. (Stage II is initiated when eight Stage I Objective Cards exist in the public gaming area). If all Strategy Cards will be picked (4 or 8 players) include the ninth Strategy Card, Prospect.
10. Reveal hidden races, discard Secret Objectives, deal 2 Political Cards to each player, and commence the first Strategy Phase. Use the rule modifications on the following pages when playing a game of Shattered Ascension. Let the war begin!

#### Scenario / Generic
Decide if a pre-made map (sample maps found in appendix 6) should be used, or conventional galaxy-building.

#### Other official variants
All Shattered Empire options are recommended, except _Simulated Early Turns_ and _Territorial DS_. _Homeworlds_, _The Ancient Throne_ and other pre-expansion official variants should not be used.

#### Game Options
View each of the recommended game options found in appendix 3.

- **Star by Star**
- **Twilight Council**
- **Dimension Rifts**
- **Ascendancy**
- **Crimson Suns**
- **Paths of Fate**

#### SAS - system
Decide if the Simultaneous Action System will be used to generalize and extend the Transfer Action. View Appendix 3.

#### Imperium Rex
Decide if Imperium Rex will be included in the Objective Deck. (Not recommended).

### Appendix I: Rule modifications

#### GENERAL:
* Any type of cargo (Fighters, Ground Forces, PDS, Leaders) may be picked up from any non-activated system (or the system just activated). This is regardless of enemy ships and cargo source (planet, carrier or space).
* Pre-Combat effects are always conducted simultaneously by attacker and defender. First both sides roll for Anti-Fighter Barrage and removing casualties. Then remaining pre-combat effects are conducted simultaneously.
* Just before refreshing planets in the Status Phase, all players may produce Trade Goods from unused resources. For every 2 resources spent, gain 1 Trade Good.
* Political Cards may not be spent as Trade Goods. 2 Political Cards may at any time be discarded for a new one.  All players also receive a Political Card during Status Phase. Hand limit is 7.
* During Tactical Retreats, destination system is activated only if and when ships survive to perform the retreat.
* Mix and Match; When building units, one resource may be spent to buy one Ground Force and one Fighter unit.
* A non-Home System planet without Ground Forces present taking a bombardment hit reverts immediately to neutral status. The bombarding player may choose to omit this effect.
* For the purpose of Action Cards, a Home System is only considered as such if the race of origin controls it.
* Opponent Home Systems may not be activated during the first round of play.
* Gravity Rifts give +1 movement when moving through them in a _non-straight line_ (i.e., not exiting on the opposite side of entering. Roll one die for each ship passing through. At a roll of 1-3, the ship ends its move in the Gravity Rift. If there are already opponent ships present, immediately conduct a Space Battle.

#### UNITS:
* Dreadnoughts roll 2 dice during Space Battles and may bombard planets without an invasion taking place. They count as 2 units towards the production limit when producing units (also for secondary of Production). 
* War Suns may use their Sustain Damage ability twice. They count as 3 units towards all production limits.
* Any unit using the Sustain Damage ability immediately loses one combat die, to a minimum of 1.
* Shock Troops are not formed at combat rolls of 10. Instead, one Ground Force will automatically upgrade to a Shock Troop unit after a successful Invasion (attacker only), during the following Production Step. Before the first round of an Invasion Combat, the attacker may assign a number of his ST’s as commandos. These do not participate in combat and cannot be taken as casualties, but they can capture 1 building each after a successful invasion. All commandos are automatically eliminated in case of a failed invasion. Shock Troops may be produced normally at a Space Dock for the cost of 3 resources each.
* Space Mines are placed on a border instead of inside a system. Space Mines are considered neutral and trigger the instant any fleet crosses the system (before PDS step). Mines cannot be stacked. Upon impact roll a number of dice equal to non-fighter ships passing through the mined border. Rolls of 8+ inflicts hit on the passing fleet. Hits may be distributed by the owner as usual.
* Facilities may only be built on unexhausted planets. The total cost of the facility is to exhaust the planet.
* PDS’ planetary shields do not obstruct any kind if bombardment, but each absorbs one bombardment hit.
* All Flagships take up 2 production capacity to build.
* Yssaril Flagship and its fleet may traverse Space Mines without triggering them, and may not be targeted by PDS fire.
* Saar Flagship has a base movement of 2 and rolls only 2 dice in anti-fighter barrage. May be built in any system.
* The Mechanized Unit is not invulnerable to bombardment and PDS fire. Bombardment hits must always be assigned to Mechanized Units first, and may not be sustained. Mechanized Units takes 2 production capacity to build.

##### Mercenaries
Mercenaries are not coupled to the Trade Strategy Card. Instead, a random Mercenary is drawn at the start of the Strategy Phase. Players may then make a simultaneous mercenary bid; this is accomplished by each player holding a number of Trade Goods tokens (may be 0) in his hand he is willing to pay for the Mercenary (these tokens may be taken from reinforcements pile, but it is not allowed to hold a number higher than the player is able to pay using his available Trade Goods, resources and/or influence. The highest bidder places the mercenary under his colors on a friendly planet or fleet. The actual bid is then paid normally by a mix of Trade Goods, resources and influence. Note; lost mercenary bids must now also be paid (in contrast to other bidding processes). Mercenaries that do not receive any bids are discarded.

Next, it is possible for any to call a loyalty bid on existing mercenaries. Here at least 2 Trade Goods must be bid by the player calling it. Other players may also join this bid. If this bid is at least two Trade Goods higher than the owners counter-bid, the mercenary will switch sides and is placed at any planet or fleet friendly to the new owner. If the mercenary is of the same race as the owner, an over-bid of three Trade Goods is required.

#### TECHNOLOGY:
* Gen Synthesis upgrades an additional Shock Troop after a successful invasion, instead of reviving your units.
* Micro Technology also allows a player to spend influence instead of resources when producing Trade Goods.
* Integrated Economy: All your planets may now produce units during the Production Step of a Tactical Action, with production capacity equal to its resource value. You may also relocate CC’s at the end of your turns.  As with Space Docks, planets may not produce units during the same round as in which they are claimed.
* Nano Technology will repair all your units at the end of your turns, instead of granting immunity to Direct Hit!
* Transit Diodes: As an action, pay one Strategy CC to move up to 6 of your Ground Forces or PDS units (PDS counts as 2) from the board to any friendly planets or fleets. Units in activated systems may not be moved. Transit Diodes has Hypermetabolism as a third independent pre-requisite.
* Fleet Logistics: As an action, once per round, you may pay 1 Strategy CC to turn one of your CC’s on the board. Units within this system are now allowed to move during future activations.
* Assault Cannons are applied to Cruisers as well as Dreadnoughts. The extra ‘shot’ means one die only, regardless of number of normal combat dice.
* Automated Defence Turrets do not gain bonus from Hylar V Assault Laser when used.
* Graviton Negator ignores all planetary shields. It also gives Cruisers the bombardment ability.
* Duranium Armor, Gravity Drive, and Neural Computing do not have any pre-requisites.
* Duranium Armor: During your tactical actions, you may ignore one hit on your forces from any combat roll. May replace Hylar V Laser as a pre-requisite.
* Gravity Drive: During your tactical actions, one of your (non-War Sun) ships receives +1 movement. May replace Antimass Deflectors as a pre-requisite.
* When using Transfabrication, the total value of the scuttled ship is received as Trade Goods. Also, when producing units at a Space Dock, you may flip another Space Dock on the board to increase to add its production capacity to the current build. Flipped Space Docks may not produce units, but is put back to normal in the Status Phase.  Transfabrication replace Enviro Compensator as a pre-requisite.

##### Race-specific Technologies:
* Sol Spec Ops Training is replaced with Versatile Combat Tactics: Your
  Ground Forces gain the Commando ability, and +1 to combat rolls when
  fighting a greater number of opponents. You may never lose more than 2
  Ground Forces to bombardment. [Cost: 3]
* Yin Yin Spinner is replaced with Moyin's GenII Elite: When producing
  units at a Space Dock, you receive one extra Ground Force that do not
  count towards production capacity. Your Shock Troops now cost 1
  resource. [Cost: 5]
* Muaat Nova Seed is used during the Strategy Phase, and takes effect at
  the end of the Status Phase. You must have ships in two systems
  adjacent to the target system, OR ships in the target system.
* Letnev non-Euclidean Shielding have a cost of 7.
* Winnu Lazax Gate Folding: When activating Mecatol Rex, any Ground
  Forces present on Winnu may be moved directly there during the
  Planetary Landings step. Ground Forces moved this way are immune to
  PDS fire. [Cost: 3]
* Saar Chaos-Mapping enables your units to stop in Asteroid Fields, but
  your ships do not block opponent movement when placed in Asteroid
  Fields. Opponent Automated Defense Turrets rolls one combat die less.

#### RACES:
* Saar Floating Factories: Your Space Docks may now retreat and withdraw from Space Battles, and may produce units in the same activation as moving. (exception; may not build when moving out of a system with a flipped CC in place).
* N’orr Berzerker Genome: At the end of any combat round in which you scored at least one hit, automatically inflict an extra hit on the opponent.
* Jol Nar Spatial Conduit Network: Your ships may ‘teleport’ (move as if it was an adjacent system) to the destination during the movement step of an activation, if the activated system contains no enemy planets or units.
* Mentak Salvage Operations yields only 1 TG from lost Space Battles. War Suns may be salvaged, but will default to a movement value of 1 without the War Sun Technology advance.
* The Mentak ability to steal Trade Goods is now an action and costs 1 CC from Strategy Allocation to execute.
* Naalu initiative ability is replaced with the following ability: Before the Action Phase begins, you may take one Tactical Action. The Action Phase will then resume as normal. Naalu starts with no Cruiser unit. Telepathic Mind Weapon triggers whenever an opponent activates a system containing one of your planets.
* Xxcha may use either the resource or influence value of a planet when counting votes. Xxcha’s race specific tech works in any system in which you control a planet. It does not cost a Command Counter to use.
* Lizix starts the game with only 1 less CC in Strategy Allocation instead of one additional. Hence CC pools are 1/3/3.
* While Muaat War Suns have 1 base movement, they bombard with 1 die only.
* Yssaril starts with 1 Carrier less, and Light/Wave Deflector as only Technology. Shuttle Logistics: During the movement step of an activation, you may move in up to 2 Ground Forces from adjacent unactivated systems. This limit is increased by 2 Ground Forces for every Strategy CC spent. Such units may participate in planetary landings as normal. If they for any reason are unnable to land, immediately return them to their original position. (Shuttled GF are unaffected by ‘Fighter Ambush’, but ships in orbit must fight a Space Battle. The token is removed regardless of this outcome).

#### STRATEGY CARDS:
* During Assembly, a player chosen to play an Agenda always has the choice of drawing one random card from the pile instead of his hand. Any player may call a Voice of the Council election before the agenda voting, but this costs 1 CC from Strategy Allocation. 
* The Voice of the Council gains +5 votes at all times in addition to being able to claim the Special Objective.
* Executing Bureaucracy Primary ability, 3 Stage I Public Objectives are drawn openly for all to see. One Objective is chosen to go to the public gaming area, while the two others are each placed either at the bottom or the top of the deck. One influence may now be spent to flip/turn the orientation of the Rotation Cycler.
* Using Warfare II Primary, the owner may take another tactical action after secondaries are conducted. This Command Counter is paid from reinforcements instead of the Command Pool. The High Alert token yields bonus to all friendly combat rolls in its present system, not just during Space Battles.
* Warfare II secondary requires only that the destination systems does not contain enemy ships. Any type of cargo may be picked up during this movement, but as always, no planetary landings may be initiated.
* Diplomacy II has an additional effect; Until you take your first hostile tactical action this round, any player doing such action against you must choose and exhaust one of their planets. (Hostile action is defined as an action that would break Trade Agreements).
* Diplomacy II secondary works adjacent (or inside) to any system in which you control planets or units.  You may never target an enemy Home System for Peaceful Annexation.
* Technology II primary has an additional option b), to execute the secondary ability up to three times without paying the CC cost. The resource cost of the secondary ability is 5.
* Production secondary may only be used on a single Space Dock.
* If using Trade (SA); when Trade Agreements are broken as a result of combat, the attacker discards all Trade Goods present on his Trade Contracts, while the defender may collect them for free.
* Include the Prospect card as long as there are 4, 7 or 8 players in the game. If this number changes during a game, remove the card from play during the next Status Phase.

##### Council Representatives
Not yet compatible with the Twilight Council game option. It is recommended to to prioritize Twilight Council over the Council Representatives.

#### MISCELLANEOUS CARDS:
* Friendly Fire: During this combat round, opposing fighters will inflict a hit on their own forces at natural rolls of 1 through 4. May target any fleet, regardless of fighter-to-ship ratio. Play: Just before a combat- round begins. 
* In the Silence of Space is not restricted by enemy units. Fleets containing Dreadnoughts or War Suns will not benefit from this card. 
* Faulty Targeting System may instead of re-rolling 1 PDS die, obstruct all PDS fire during movement step.
* Rare Mineral: Receive 3 Trade Goods.	Play: Immediately after acquiring any planet.
* Privateers: Choose an opponent, and claim half of his current Trade Goods (round down).  Play: As an action.
* Signal Jam Your opponent’s Command Counter must be placed ship-side up (for rules on flipped Command Counters, see Fleet Logistics). Friendly Home System may me targeted.
* Tech Bubble costs no additional resources to play.
* Secret Objective ‘Merciless’ may be accomplished against any opponent.
* Secret Objective ‘Threatening’ I control 6 ships and 4 Ground Forces adjacent to two opponent Home Systems (may not ‘overlap’, and units adjacent to own HS is not threatening in this context).

#### LEADERS:
* For movement purposes, Leaders are considered Ground Forces that takes no capacity. Thus Technology Advances or Action Cards that allows movement of Ground Forces may also move Leaders (e.g Transit Diodes and Shuttle Logistics). Leaders may also be moved freely within their system between the steps of your own turns, if the system contains no enemy ships.
* Generals may use both Invasion Combat abilities (re-roll and +1) in both attack and defense.
* Agents may only Sabotage Action Card effects that takes place in their present system. Doing so, an Agent may not Sabotage other cards this round or through the entire next round. Such a Sabotage does not sacrifice the Agent. In respect to this ability, all political oriented Action Cards (e.g Thugs,) are considered to take place on Mecatol Rex,and all cards targeting the race sheet (e.g Insubordination, Cultural Crisis) takes place within your Home System. Enemy Leaders are automatically captured when defeated in a Space Battle or Invasion Combat with an Agent present.
* Diplomats may, in addition, let an active enemy fleet pass through a friendly fleet present in the same system. When present with an attacking fleet, Diplomats may allow opposing fleets to retreat before the Space Battle begins. This will not break Trade Agreements. A Diplomat delaying an invasion obstructs the entire Invasion Combat sequence, including all Bombardment. This ability, (to obstruct an invasion) may be overturned by the enemy at the cost of 10 influence. When this happens, the Diplomat will escape, un- exhausted, to another friendly planet or fleet.
* Scientists, instead of restricting War Sun bombdardment, may absorb one extra bombardment hit when together with a PDS unit (this does not count as a planetary shield).
* Consult these Fate Rolls when a Leader falls in either Space Battle or Invasion Combat: 1 Killed, 2-8 Captured, 9-10 Escaped.
* Captured opponent Leaders are marked with a flag, and retains their position on the board, planet or space. Such captives simply work as passive cargo that takes no capacity. If the planet (ship) that holds the captured Leader is invaded (destroyed), a new fate roll is in order. When a Leader ‘escapes’ or is ‘captured’ by friendly forces, simply put the Leader back to play normally within the system.
* Captured Leaders may be handed to other players during the Status Phase, but only to fleets or planets adjacent to the present location of the captured Leader.
* When executing an opponent leader during Status Phase, you must choose and exhaust one planet.

#### DISTANT SUNS:
* Native Knowledge; Before the game starts, all players may secretly look at any one Domain Counter.
* Deep Space Probing Vessels; During the Strategy Phase, each player may freely probe one planet in a system adjacent to each friendly Space Dock on the board
* Fighters may perform either a Low Orbit Probing, or a High Orbit Probing (quick probing). The first works exactly as original probing rules. High Orbit Probing works as follows: Distribute all available Fighters to planets being probed. Immediately before the Planetary Landings step of the activation, roll 1 die for each Fighter. On unmodified roll of 8+, the planet is successfully probed. 
* All Domain Counter units are treated as regular units in respect to all combat. Such units can be bomb- arded, converted or captured just like corresponding plastic units. However, the Domain Token is still a Domain Token with respect to Razing, Peaceful Annexation, etc. 
* Lazax Survivors are subject to no special rules/effect when probed. They must be encountered normally.
* Natural Wealth only yields 1 Trade Good upon encountering the Domain. Place all remaining Trade Goods on the planet. The controlling player may take one such TG from the planet when activating the system (during the Production Step), and one during each Refresh Planets step of the Status Phase. Whenever an opponent successfully invades a planet with existing Natural Wealth he may immediately take one of the Trade Goods present.
* Instead of “Hostage Situation”, roll a D10, divide by 2 and round down. This is how many Natural Resources and Hostile Locals there are in this Domain. Place the number of TG counters on the Domain Counter to keep track of this number. As soon as the Hostile Locals are defeated, the token is removed and the remaining Natural Resources work just as Natural Wealth (see above). 
* Hidden Factory: You have discovered an ancient factory with old ships worth repairing. You may immediately build ships in the system for up to two production capacity. You receive 1 resource discount on this build.
* Settlers always belongs to a random opponent (roll as usual). The discovering player may choose to land immediately.
* If a Leader dies as a result of Domain encounters, the Leader always escapes instead.

#### Objective Cards and Victory
* All Objective cards, including Special Objectives, are claimed simultaneously by all players in the Objectives-step of the status phase.
* Victory ensues to moment the number of required Victory Points (VP) are attained by any player.
* If this happens simultaneously, victory goes to the player ending up with the most VP. If this is equal, victory goes the player who controls most planets outside his Home System. In the unlikely case that this also is equal, the other participants around the board must vote for either a ‘moral winner’ or a split victory.
* Objective Cards that yields “I win the game” are technically worth as many VP as required to win the current game. E.g, in a game played to 10 VP, this Objective is worth exactly 10 VP.
* In addition to the SA-exclusive Objective Cards, include Objectives from both Shattered Empire and the original game.

#### Race-specific Technology Acquisition
There are only two ways of acquiring Race-specific Technologies:
1. Driving Force of Progress: When a race reaches a number of Victory Points equal the extra cost printed on the Race- Specific Technology card, they may acquire this card for for free (in the Status Phase).
2. Exigent Research: The Race-specific Technology may be purchased during Status Phase for the the resource cost indicated on the card.
When a Race-specific Technology is aquired, increase the cost of the
remaining ones by the cost of the card just acquired.

#### Progression Feedback
During each Strategy Phase the player with the most Victory Points receives a number of Trade Goods equal to the difference in Victory Points obtained by the player in second place.

#### Action Cards
It is not required to ‘announce’ the playing of an Action Card. Simply play the card during the proper time, and the effect is immediately carried out.

Caution: Playing Emergency Repairs will not obstruct the effect of a Direct Hit card, and Cultural Crisis will not obstruct the effect of a Multiculturalism card.

#### Galactic Trade
Trade Goods received through Trade Agreements are acquired simultaneously by all players. TGs are always accessible, even if the cardboard pile is dry. In this case use replacement counters.  In 3 and 4 player games, players may trade one of their Trade Agreements with themselves (simply flip the card around to show the active side). In 2-player games, both trades can be self-traded.

#### Artifact Research
Artifacts also work as Tech Specialty of the indicated color. These work even if they exist on an exhausted planet. A Scientist may as usual double this efficiency if placed on the same planet or space system as the Artifact. Artifacts do not count toward Objectives based on acquiring Tech Specialty planets, however. Empty Artifacts are worth 2 Trade Goods upon discovery.

#### Creation/Resource Abundancy
Prior to dealing out tiles creating a galaxy using the standard method (or that described in Star by Star), remove all 4 high resource systems from the deck (Bereg, Abyz, Meer, Ashtroth). For optimal maps, no more than 4 resources should exist adjacent to a Home System (unless these are equally close to another), and no more than 8 resources should exist on the board per player in total. If this limit is violated, remove resources from play (after galaxy completion)by swapping existing systems with lesser ones to meet the limits. If it is the total resource limit that is breached, remove resources around the player that has the most resources in the vicinity.

#### The Rotation Cycler
All player-to-player turn rotation, i.e the order of Strategy Card selection, Strategy card 2ndary execution and political voting are all done in direction of this marker. (See changes on the Bureaucracy Strategy Card, appendix 1).

#### Increased Plastic & CC limit
If available, it’s recommended to increase the number of units available, to open for new strategies and fleet compositions When this is done, include the Global Fleet Supply rules:
* Every Strategy Phase, players must pay an upkeep in resources, equal to how much his Fleet Supply exceeds 8. For example, a race with Fleet Supply of 10 would have to pay 2 resources every Strategy Phase. Any such Fleet Supply that are not paid upkeep for are immediately removed.
* No more than three (Saar) Space Docks may exist in the same system. 
* The number of units recquired for Objectives does not change. "All" refers to the original limit.

New limits:

- 24 Command Counters
- 12 Cruisers
- 15 Destroyers
- 7 Dreadnoughts
- 8 Carriers
- 3 War Suns
- 9 PDS
- 4 Space Docks

### Appendix 3: Variants and Extras

#### Game option: Star by Star
Using this game option, the galaxy is built with Home Systems free in your hand instead of fixed starting locations. Tiles may be placed anywhere that borders an existing tile as long as it is inside the size bounds of the map. Players place their tiles in turns rotating around the table rather than alternating back and forth. Yellow-bordered systems may not be placed adjacent to other yellow-bordered systems. The rule that demands a planet placement after a blank placement may be ignored. The Mecatol Custodians must be in play (and may be doubled in strength prior to galaxy setup).

In addition, utilize the following changes:

* Muaat may not be placed adjacent to Mecatol Rex.
* Your players on your left and on your right are considered your ‘neighbors’ regardless of Home System location.
* Artifacts may be placed in space, under the same conditions of control as Trade Stations.
* Artifacts may be placed adjacent to a Home System if it is equally close to another Home SYstem
* Red-bordered tiles may be placed adjacent to eachother, but cannot surround a yellow-bordered tile.
* It is prohibited to place a tile such that it forces a yellow-bordered tiles to be adjacent on the following placement.


#### Game option: Crimson Suns (Beta)
Players may ‘Declare War’ on opponents during the Status Phase, at the cost of 1 infuence. Take one of their flags and place it together with a hit marker on your race sheet to symbolize a War Declaration. When you attack a player you have a War Declaration on, “sympathetic factions of the galaxy” will subside you with a number of TGs equal to half of the value (round down) of ships you lose in Space Battles attacking this opponent. If you defend against a player that you have a War Declaration on, you receive one forth of the value lost in ships (round down). TG’s are received at the end of the Space Battle.

Declaring War immediately breaks Trade Agreements, and accepting a Trade Agreements breaks the War Declaration. You may only have two War Declarations active at a time.

#### Game option: Dimension Rifts
Whenever a blank Artifact is discovered, draw a random double sided Wormhole Token (if available) and place it in the system. The active player chooses which side to be active (face up).  Whenever a fleet enters such a Wormhole, flip the Token around. Wormholes of this type are ignored for all Objective purposes, but are affected by political agendas. This option is not necessary using the preset maps (appendix 5).

#### Game option: Covenants (Available for 2-4 players)
With this setting, each player will command two races in struggle for galactic dominance. Follow the normal setup from the first page, with the following differences.

* Step 1) When choosing game duration (Victory Points goal), increase the chosen VP range with 50%.
* Step 3) Deal one extra Secret Objective to each player.
* Step 4) Move two rounds around the board so that ever player gets a second race.
* Step 5) During the bidding phase of a pre-set scenario, only one race is bid for one race at a time. 
* Step 10) Assign two of your Secret Objectives as preferred to your two races, discarding the third one. Political cards are dealt to each race. Hand cards, both Action and Political Cards, belong to a specific race and may not be interchanged.

* During the Strategy Phase, upon choosing Strategy Cards, only one card are chosen and given to the race of your preference before the deck passes on. The selection then continues for another round.
* Opponents means opponent players, not the other race.
* Victory ensues when your two races collectively have acquired the Victory Points required to win. 

#### Game option: The Ancient Empire (a Distant Suns variant)
Distant Suns can be played using all Domain Counters face-up and visible right from the start of the game.

* When using a pre-set scenario, randomly distribute Domain Counters to all planets before Home System bidding takes place. The nature of local Domain Counters will affect the value of the HS locations.
* When building the galaxy by normal tile placement, players may, after map completion, in turn draw a random Domain Counter and place it visible side up on ANY planet on the board. Continue until all planets have one. This should ensure a fair distribution.

Using this variant, Saar, Winnu and Lizix may experience a small initial advantage (because of starting movement) and may be excluded.

#### Game option: Ascendancy
Using this game option, Victory Point progression will be more steady and less in leaps, and place focus on holding strategical positions. Make the following changes when using this game option:

* Multiply the Victory Points goal value (to win) by three.
* When claiming Objectives, do not mark it with a flag. All Objectives (except Secret Objectives) are claimable any number of times.
* Any number of different Objectives may be claimed during the Objectives-step of the Status Phase.
* All “spend”-Objectives have their required value halved, and may be claimed any number of times during the same Status Phase.
* All technology-based Objectives are removed from game.
* All Secret Objectives are worth 6 Victory Points.

##### Ascendancy-specific Bureaucracy mod
Instead of being able to claim one Objective, the same procedure as the Objectives-step of the Status Phase are executed. Also, the card now yields no Command Counter. Otherwise the card works as normal.

##### Ascendancy Race-Tech acquisition:
Force of Progress: Race techs are now acquired when Victory Points equal to double the resource cost are attained. Exigent Research: No change.

##### Ascendancy Progression Feedback:
The player in the lead with Victory Points will now only receive a number of TG’s equal to half the VP difference to second place (round up).

#### Game option: Paths of Fate
During Step 10 of the game initiation checklist, each player secretly chooses one of the three race-specific Secret Objective cards. This is kept in addition to the regular Secret Objective Only one Secret Objective may be claimed during each Status Phase.

#### Game option: Twilight Council
All players reveal one agenda in the beginning of the Strategy Phase, placed face-up in the common play area and marked with a race flag. Each player may only have 1 agenda revealed at a time. These may be changed in the beginning of each Strategy Phase.

The Primary of Assembly is changed as follows: 

> Receive 2 AC and 1 PC. Choose a) or b):
> 
> a) Claim Speaker Token and choose three of other players revealed agendas to be voted for. (In 3 and 4 player games only two agendas are required) 
> 
> b) Give Speaker Token to someone else and choose any agenda from the board to be voted for. Then choose up to three more face-up agendas that each may either be included for voting or discarded.

Multiple agendas are placed in a visible enforcement order, in case this is of any relevance. All voting happens simultaneously by all players (write down in advance). Your total votes must be split among the included agendas.  Voice of the Council elections happens simultaneously as a normal agenda. Agendas without any votes are discarded.

_Example: The Winnu gives the Speaker Token to Sol (option B), and chooses Imperial Mandate, which is their own revealed agenda. In addition they scour through the agendas and includes Mutiny (1). They discard Norr’s Fleet Regulations agenda to the discard pile (2), and does the same to Wormhole Research (3). The card says ‘up to three’, so Winnu have spent their normal choices. But hoping to draw away some critical votes, Winnu spend a CC from Strategy to include Voice of the Council as well. Now all the players must place their total votes carefully, split among Munity, Imperial Mandate and VoC, while Winnarian fleets are safe from the discarded agendas. Starting with the first agenda, players simultaneously reveal their votes and conduct the effect of the agenda before proceeding to the next, and so forth._

#### Game Option/Add-on: The Simultaneous Action System
The Simultaneous Action System is an extension/generalization of the regular Transfer Action. The purpose increased flexibility to allow every logical movment through use of a general system rather than special conditions found in the Transfer Action.  Ships being transferred between two systems with the Transfer action is in this regard only a very basic case of two “simultaneous actions”.

First, place a CC in each the systems you wish included in the movement grid. One of these CC is paid directly from your reinforcements pile. Ships may now move (”transfer”) between all the active systems, but no unit may exceed it’s movement value. Now, only one of these systems are granted a full activation, that is, being able to perform any kind of action other than movement (beyond step 2 of the Tactical Action). More systems may be granted a full activation at the cost of 1 additional CC each. Following the normal sequence of activation, conduct all similar steps (Space Battles, Invasion Combat and production, etc.) in each system at appropritate times.

The difference from Transfer Action can be broken down to three points:
1. It is possible to activate any number of hexes to be included in the “movement grid”.
2. There are no restrictions to which hexes allowed to be included, but cost may vary (see text).
3. You can perform all normal actions within a Simultaneous Action, e.g produce, invade etc. (at additional cost, see text).

> Note that units may only move from an active system to another, unlike the standard Tactical Action. Also, all Space Battles/Movement happens simultaneously. Thus Its not allowed to use such actions to destroy a fleet and then hit a system beyond it during a single turn. However, since it happens simultaneously, enemy each PDS unit, friendly or enemy, may fire at only one of the active systems.

##### Example movement:
You notice a situation close to your Space Docks in system A. Last round you sent a Carrier full of Ground Forces into the adjacent system B with enemy controlled planets. The attack was a total disaster, and your empty Carrier remains in that system. You realize that if you want to proceed with the offensive this or the next round, you will lock down the empty carrier in system B. If you choose to move it home to A first, you will lock down your base and be unnable to attack. After some planning, you decide to make a simultaneous action with A and B as your movement-grid, attack the enemy planet in B once more while bringing your Carrier home to base to load up new cargo. But then both systems A and B need a full activation since they both require an action other than plain movement (i.e build, invade). At the same time you notice that you want your Cruisers in system C (two spaces away) to trade places with some Destroyers from your home system, so you decide to include system C into the movement grid.

Summing up, you activate the 3 system grid A, B, C with 2 CC from Command Pool, where you choose your Space Docks (A) as the fully activated system. Additionally, system B will have to be fully activated in order to perform an Invasion Combat (or anything beyond step 2 of the Tactical Action). For a total cost of 3 CC you manage to pull off the movement.

#### Player Option: Surrender
> This option remedies the impact on the game if a player will have to or wishes to leave the table, perhaps due to being practically eliminated and have little future effect on the game. This should ensure a fair cont- inuation of the game.

A player may, after having passed, call the Surrender. Doing so, immediately remove his flag from any Special Objectives and then subtract an additional VP from the score. Trade Agreements are kept until elimination. If the surrendered player was Speaker, the token moves one step in the direction of the cycler. After refreshing planets in the Status Phase, do:

1. Remove all of the surrendered player’s Leaders, and Space Docks outside his Home System.
2. Add up to three, to a maximum of five total Ground Forces on the planet of highest resource value in the surrendered HS. These will be passive neutral forces protecting the planet normally.
3. Speaker then chooses a planet (not the passive HS planet) or fleet belonging to the surrendered player. In turns players will place bids, in influence, on ownership of the selected fleet or planet.  Only the winning bid of influence (or TG as influence) are paid for. Planets are transfered refreshed.
4. The next player (again in the direction of the cycler) may then choose the next planet/fleet and place a bid in the same way. Repeat this step until all ships and planets (except the neutral HS planet) are taken over by opponents.
5. Resume game as normal after an elimination.

### Appendix 4: 2 Player Games
> Author’s note: Even without the diplomatic aspect of the game, the depth of tactics and strategy of Twilight Imperiujm 3rd edition makes for a deeply intruiging 2-player game, in fact my favorite one. Shattered Ascension ensures that the game is balanced and fit for this chess-like version of the game. Here player based luck variance is minimal, and it goes right down to skill of warfare and resource management.

#### Initiation
Follow the guidelines on the first page, except Step 3). Secret Objectives are not used. Two player games are normally set on a two ring galaxy with home systems on opposite sides. It is recommended to pre-construct a map or use one of the 2-player maps in appendix 6. Victory is claimed upon reaching the required number of Victory Points (6-10) or eliminating the other player. 

The two additional Special Objective Cards, Magisterial and Imperial, should not be used in 2-player games. Crimson Suns and Twilight Council are also unfit for 2-player games. Blank Artifacts may be removed.

#### Strategy and Status Phase 
* Both players picks three Strategy Cards, leaving two with Bonus Counters.
* Both Players receive one fewer Command Counter during Status Phase. * Caution: If you are the Speaker and had Assembly during last round, you may not choose the Assembly Strategy Card as your first pick.

#### To construct a 2-player map using normal turn-placement:
* Place a random red tile in the middle.
* Remove all high-resource systems and deal 8 tiles to each player.
* Place tiles normally.
* Remove 2 blank Artifacts and hand 1 to each player for normal placement.
* Add an Artifact at Mallice and one in the middle tile if possible.

#### Trade
Races in duel games may only trade with themselves, but require permission from Trade Master as usual.

The second option on the Trade II Strategy Card to break Trade Agreements breaks ALL trade in the game,
not just those of your opponent. No Trade Agreements may be formed that round, and no income is received.
This is also the case for Trade III.


#### Politics and Assembly
To reflect uncertain votes from other players, extra votes shift in random direction. When the two opponents have placed their votes on a political agenda, roll one die and consult the results below.

1. 10 votes against Speaker
2. 6 votes against Speaker
3. 3 votes against Speaker
4. 1 vote against Speaker
5. Abstain
6. Abstain
7. 1 vote for Speaker
8. 3 votes for Speaker
9. 6 votes for Speaker
10. 10 votes for Speaker

Before the die is rolled, TGs may be spent to buy one vote. (For example, if Speaker pays 3 TG and rolls '4', the votes will shift to 2 in his favor.)

Ps! During the first round the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, 4 votes on each side of the die.

A VoC election may not be called for during the first round. Vote bonus from VoC is only+3 (not +5) in duel games.

There are no restrictions to who may receive Speaker Token, regardless of current Speaker.
