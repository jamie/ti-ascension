\begin_layout Section*

\color red
Variant: Shattered Ascension
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color red
Shattered Ascension is a set of homebrew rules modifications with many years
 of playtesting behind them.
 It is recommended that all Shattered Ascension rules be used, rather than
 only some.
 Additionally, the people behind it don't have fond opinions of the Shards
 of the Empire expansion, and none of the SA rules take it into account.
 That might change in the next year or two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color red
As this is intended to be a unified rule set, Shattered Ascension changes
 are included in-line with the regular rules, and will affect everything
 from technology, to units, to cards, to racial abilities....
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color red
Finally, game setup proceeds a little differently for SA games, as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\color red
Roll a die to determine setup Turn Order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\color red
Before assigning Races, deal two Secret Objective cards to each player.
 One of these must be discarded before the Player Setup step of setup, 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 any hidden races are revealed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\color red
Instead of randomly assigning Races, in play order each player may select
 a Race or pass.
 If they pass, after all other players have chosen a race they receive one
 at random and may keep it hidden until the Player Setup step of setup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\color red
Instead of building an Objective Deck, simply shuffle the individual Objective
 Card decks, drawing Objectives as needed.
 (Shattered Empire decks with additional SA cards included is recommended.)
 Begin by revealing the top three Stage I objectives, and once there are
 8 Stage I objectives on the board begin revealing Stage II objectives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\color red
After creating the galaxy, players bid on where they would like their starting
 galaxy, rather than having them predetermined.
 Each player then receives the difference between their bid and the highest
 bid in Trade Goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\color red
Don't assign the Speaker at random.
 After creating the galaxy, players bid for the Speaker Token, in reverse
 Turn Order.
 The winning bidder is assigned Speaker and all other players receive that
 player's bid in Trade Goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\color red
After creating the galaxy, after Home System and Speaker bidding wars are
 complete each player draws/discards the same number of Trade Good tokens,
 such that the player with the lowest amount starts with 1 Trade Good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\color red
Before Player Setup, players with hidden races reveal them, and players
 must discard one of their Secret Objectives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\color red
After the Player Setup phase is complete, the Speaker may set the orientation
 of the Rotation Cycler, after which the first Strategy Phase begins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Objective Cards are the primary way for players to receive victory points.
 Each Objective card contains a requirement and a victory point award for
 meeting that requirement.
 During the first step of the Status Phase, players may qualify for the
 requirements of 
\emph on
one (no more)
\emph default
 revealed Public Objective Card in order to receive the corresponding victory
 points.
 Additionally, each player may qualify for their Secret Objective Card at
 this time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some Objective Cards state 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now I...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to specify that the player fulfil the requrement during the first step
 of the Status Phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A player may only receive victory points from any given Objective Card only
 once per game.
 After collecting victory points, as a reminder, the player should place
 one of his Control Markers on the card.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
The Public Objective Deck
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Public Objective deck is constructed in two steps: Shuffle 3 (4 if playing
 with the Bureaucracy variant Strategy Card) random Stage II objectives
 together with the 
\noun on
Imperium Rex
\noun default
 objective, then shuffle 6 random Stage I objectives together, and place
 on top of the Stage II cards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This deck is placed in the common play area, and the first Objective Card
 is drawn before play begins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Option: Variant Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Shattered Empire expansion comes with an alternate deck of Public Objectives
 that encorage more conflict than the original Objective decks.
 Players should use either the original or Shattered public objective cards,
 and not mix them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color red
Ascension includes 12 extra public objectives.
 These should be mixed with 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 the base and Shattered public objectives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Option: The Long War
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When constructing the Public Objective Deck, use two extra cards from each
 of Stage I and II, and play to 14 Victory Points rather than 10.
 Optionally, for a more consistent (and slightly longer) game duration replace
 the Imperium Rex card with an additional random Stage II card, ending the
 game after the Status Phase after the last card is drawn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Option: Age of Empire
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After step 4, deal out the Objective Deck in a line.
 After drawing Imperium Rex, stop drawing.
 During the game, players may qualify for the victory points of 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 of the revealed Objective Cards.
 No additioanl cards will enter the game.
 After the Status Phase of the first round, place a 
\noun on
Turn token
\noun default
 on the leftmost card.
 After each subsequent Status Phase, move the Turn token one card to the
 right.
 When the Turn token moves onto Imperium Rex, the game ends immediately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Players may not qualify for Stage II objectives during the first three rounds
 of play.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Secret Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the beginning of the game, each player receives a Secret Objective card.
 A player is not allowed to show other players this card until he is able
 to meet its objectives during the first step of the Status Phase.
 A player who reveals their Secret Objective Card early 
\emph on
loses his Secret Objective Card.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shattered Empire comes with additional Secret Objectives that should be
 shuffled into the base deck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Option: Preliminary Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Shards expansion comes with a deck of 10 Preliminary Objectives, which
 are easier, less valuable secret objectives.
 When playing with these, deal one to each player during game setup 
\emph on
instead of
\emph default
 the regular Secret Objectives.
 After a player claims their Preliminary Objective, they then draw a Secret
 Objective from the deck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Special Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When playing with the Artifacts or Voice of the Council options, additional
 Objective cards may be available.
 These objectives are revealed from the beginning of the game, and may only
 be claimed by one player at a time, and the player losing the objective
 also loses the associated victory points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Galaxy Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Place the Mecatol Rex system in the middle of the table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create three piles of systems: Special (red-bordered), Empty (no planets),
 and Regular.
 Shuffle together the systems specified in the previous section for the
 number of people playing.
 Deal these systems out to the players.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Starting with the Speaker and continuing clockwise 
\color red
(in Turn Order)
\color inherit
, players place their home system about two feet away from Mecatol Rex in
 an appropriate home system location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In order, players each place one of their systems in the galaxy.
 Remember to keep space for Home Systems.
 After each player has placed a system, the order of play reverses.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The following rules apply to placing systems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each ring surrounding Mecatol Rex must be filled before systems may be placed
 in the next ring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may not place a Special System (with an inner red border) adjacent to
 another Special System, unless you have no other option.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you placed a system that did not contain a planet during your last placement,
 you must, if able, place a system that does contain a planet during this
 placement.
 If you are unable to do so, you must reveal your remaining systems to the
 other players to prove this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\color red
If a player does not receive one planet-containing system per ring in the
 galaxy, reshuffle and re-deal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\noun on
\color red
Option: Star by Star
\noun default
 - Players may choose to keep Home Systems in their hand and place them
 (hidden) as regular systems.
 Order of placement does not alternate.
 Home Systems may not be placed adjacent to each other, and the preceeding
 restriction on planet-free systems is lifted.
 The Custodians of Mecatol Rex must be in play, and may be doubled in strength.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

No home system may be activated by an enemy during the first round, Muaat
 must be placed in the outside ring, and the players sitting at your left
 and right are considered your neighbors, regardless of proximity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Options: Set up Distant Suns and Artifacts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Galaxy Layouts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With 6 players, a Home System is located at each corner at the edge of the
 galaxy.
 With other numbers of players, the position of Home Systems will differ
 as diagrammed.
 Yellow hexes indicate Home Systems, numbers indicate bonus TG given to
 the player starting there.

Trade stations may never be invaded.
 Instead, whenever a player has ships in a system with no opposing ships,
 he immediately places his control marker on the station and gains control
 of the station's planet card, exhausted.
 Capturing a Trade Station from an opponent does not break trade agreements.

Voting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the active player has read the agenda out loud, the Galactic Council
 must resolve the agenda.
 Players first debate, threaten, lure, or convince each other to vote in
 their favor.
 Trade Good counters may be used as bribes, but no promises or agreements
 are considered binding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Players then vote upon the agenda.
 Starting with the player to the left of the speaker, each player casts
 their vote in turn, or abstain.
 A player has as many votes as the total combined influence of all his 
\emph on
unexhausted
\emph default
 planets (or a minimum of 1), and must cast all his votes, or none.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of a tie vote, the player holding the Speaker Token breaks the
 tie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Voting does not cause your Planet Cards to exhaust.
 Trade Good counters cannot be used to gain additional votes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*

\color red

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color red
The Voice of the Council gains +5 votes at all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Option: Political Intrigue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a more robust political system, play with this option using either the
 Political II or Assembly II Strategy Card.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During setup, each player receives his race's three Representative Cards,
 and the five Promissory Note cards matching his color.
 Players use these cards to represent their race in the Galactic Council
 and to create binding contracts.
 In addition, when using the Political II Strategy Card, draw the top two
 Political Cards during setup and place them faceup in the play area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Council Steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Active Player chooses one available Political Card to resolve and all
 players follow these steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Assembly II
\emph default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The active player draws two Political Cards.
 Then, they choose a player to resolve one Political Card from his (the
 chosen player's) hand.
 Finally, they choose a different player to receive the Speaker Token.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Choose Representatives
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Each player chooses a Representative and plays it facedown in front of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Resolve Spies
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Starting with the Speaker and continuing clockwise (in rotation order),
 each player who chose a Representative with the Spy trait must reveal it
 and then resolve its special ability.
 If the ability targets another player's Representative, reveal the target
 immediately.
 After all Spies are revealed, reveal all other Representatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Resolve Bargaining and Promissory Notes
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Players may now offer Trade Goods or Promissory Notes to convince each other
 to vote in their favor.
 
\emph on
Only Promissory Notes are binding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Resolve Voting and Outcome
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Players now vote upon the agenda as usual.
 Representatives add their bonus votes (in the top left corner of the card
 or granted via a special ability) to the player's influence total.
 If a Representative is assassinated or killed (or a player who has had
 all three Representatives killed off) does not vote 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Representatives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All representatives have a number of bonus votes (in the top-left corner
 of the card) added to a player's total votes for the current agenda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Spies are revealed before other Representatives, and resolve their abilities
 during the Resolve Spies step.
 Spies target other Representatives with assassinations and other game effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Bodyguards cannot be assassinated, and sometimes have certain effects when
 targeted by a spy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Councilors generally have more bonus votes than Spies or Bodyguards, but
 are more susceptible to certain cards and abilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a Representative is assassinated (or otherwise killed by other game
 effects), he is removed from the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Promissory Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During Political Intrigue, players have a chance to offer other players
 Promissory Notes.
 Each player may only offer one Promissory Note per Political Card.
 If a player accepts a Promissory Note, he is bound to vote as was agreed
 upon with the player offering the note.
 A player does not reveal the note to other players (although he may talk
 about what he received).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each Promissory Note has a binding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

favor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the player that offered the Note to fulfil.
 The favor must be fulfilled by the offering player at any time the receiving
 player decides to play the note.
 Starting with the Speaker, each player follows these steps to offer a Promissor
y Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player may offer one note face down to another player and ask him to
 vote a specific way for this Political Card.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The receiving player looks at the note and either agrees to vote in that
 way and keeps the card, or refuses and returns the note to the offering
 player.
 Players may also make additional agreements along with the giving of Promissory
 Notes, but these verbal agreements are not binding.
